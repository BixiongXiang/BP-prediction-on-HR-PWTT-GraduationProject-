Blood Pressure prediction based on Heart Rate &amp; Pulse Wave Transit Time (GraduationProject)

This software is used for signal processing and blood pressure prediction.

I buld it with an GUI that researcher can easily use this tool to solve problems relating to blood pressure prediction based on 
paulse wave transit time and Heart rate

Guides:
Please open this file in Matlab R2015b or higher version, otherwise there may be some display problems.
After launching the program, you can load the <39m12.mat> data file to get a feel about this program.
